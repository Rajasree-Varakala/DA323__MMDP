My heart is drifting southward To my home down in the sea It痴 the isle of St. Helena Where my loved ones wait for me Long since I left it But I値l soon be going home To my St. Helena island And swear I値l never roam Diamonds they are pretty So is your fancy cars But St. Helena island Is prettier by far All the wonders of this world I知 told they number seven But St. Helena Island Is the nearest one to heaven Diamonds they are pretty So is your fancy cars But St. Helena island Is prettier by far Someday if the Lord above Comes out of heaven痴 gate I知 sure He値l pick St. Helena And use it as His place
